# dotfiles
Just my dotfiles, kept on GitHub for easy access when working on other computers.
Use at your own risk.

Install by cloning the repo into your home directory, then running `install.sh`, which creates symlinks that place each file or directory in the location expected by the program it is meant to configure (`install.sh` will not overwrite existing files, which you will have to manually remove if you want to use the version in this repository).

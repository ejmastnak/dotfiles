Just my dotfiles, kept on GitHub for easy access when working on other computers.
Use at your own risk.

Install by running `install.sh`, which creates symlinks placing each file or directory in the correct location expected by the program it is meant to configure (`install.sh` will not overwrite existing files, which you will have to manually remove if you want to use the version in this repository).
